## ***PONYTOWN INFO***
• **Online**; never use lol.

• **Away**; my normal status! though as the name states, i may or may not be afk, so its best you just whisper to me instead!

• **Busy**; normally means im afk, making a skin or something else. again, its best you just whisper to me.

• **Looking for chat/roleplay**; never use either.

> cuddles are fine, so are kisses (i usually wont kiss back though) and boops! if i leave mid conversation, i apologize - i mightve gotten overwhelmed/too nervous, but always know im not ghosting you!

> i dont actually speak this formally, i just have a mild typing quirk where i usually Capitalize random Letters in a sentence, Like This One right Now! the formalness is just so i dont sound awkward. if i act blunt/rude out of nowhere or at first, its not intentional, i dont bite, i promise!

> *COMMUNICATION IS KEY!* if ur one of my friends, please let me know BEFOREHAND that youd like to sit with me! it overwhelms me if you just come by the area i frequent the most and just sit with me before asking me and i might get scared and leave a few minutes later ,, sitting anywhere near me is ok, you just have to ask me!
